# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To identify user pain points, write clear UX problem statements, choose appropriate research methods, and create user personas for two apps (a Government Service app and a Health app) to produce a ready-to-submit UX lab report.

## Algorithm:
1.Select scenarios choose the two apps: Government Service (UMANG) and Health (Doctor/Health Checker). 2.Gather initial observations review screenshots and jot common user complaints (form confusion, long login). 3.Identify pain points list concrete user problems for each scenario. 4.Write problem statements use the template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]." 5.Choose research methods pick methods per scenario (e.g., interviews, usability testing, surveys, A/B testing) and write brief justifications. 6.Create personas craft at least two personas (demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, motivation) representing typical users. 7.Prepare deliverables compile content into a PDF lab report and add images; create a GitHub repo and upload the PDF. 8.Summarize outputs list files, repo URL, and a short conclusion for submission.
## Output:
